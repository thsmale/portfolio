### [-> FinFriends URL](https://finfriends.netlify.app/)

FinFriends computes the least amount of transactions required among friends.

It then displays this data to the user.

![Fin Friends UI](./fin-friends-ui-example.png)

This web application is built using React.

The React component library being used is grommet.

React is a Javascript framework for programming front end web applications.

There is a backend API server written in the Python framework fastapi.

The front end sends the bills to the backend server which runs a python script
to compute the least amount of Venmo's required. It then returns these results
to the user in the UI.
